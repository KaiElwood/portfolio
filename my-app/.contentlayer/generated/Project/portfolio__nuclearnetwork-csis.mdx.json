The backend was built using PHP and the front-end was built using HTML, CSS, and JS. The website is currently used by the Project on Nuclear Issues, a program launched in 2003 to develop the next generation of policy, technical and operational nuclear professionals through outreach, mentorship, research and debate. You can access the website here: [Project on Nuclear Issues](https://nuclearnetwork.csis.org/).\n\nDuring this process, I learned best practices for css, including mixins, consistent variables and the importance of responsive design. Our design team did an excellent job of providing specifications, which made the development process a lot easier. I also learned how much easier it is to use reusable font names and components, as opposed to the gobbledygook I had been writing in most of my student projects up until that point :). \n\nThis was one of many projects for programs that I worked on at CSIS, but it was also one of the projects where I was pretty much involved from start to finish. CSIS is a great place to work!",
