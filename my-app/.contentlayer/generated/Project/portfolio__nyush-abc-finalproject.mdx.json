I worked with a group of 3 other students to design and put together creative messaging app that allowed each user to draw on a shared canvas and send messages to each other in real-time. The app was built using P5.js for the canvas and socket.io for the real-time messaging. The backend was built using node.js.\n\nMaking this project was a lot of fun! The hardest parts about it were figuring out how to take screenshots of the p5 canvas and then send those to the front-end.\n{/* how did we do this? I don't remember' */}\n\nThe final app can still be accessed here: [Creative Messaging App](https://outgoing-painted-scorpio.glitch.me/)\n",
