## Current Work

My current work at Mathematica Policy Research takes on a variety of forms, but almost all of it is unfortunately publicly unavailable.

The tools I use on a day to day basis involve all aspects of the stack. At Mathematica, we often use C# for our backend api, Angular and RX.js for our frontend, and MySQL for our database. We typically run all of our infrastructure on AWS, and we use a lot of code-as-infrastructure tools like Cloudformation and Serverless.

I've been able to level up drastically as a developer at Mathematica, since I've worked on all sides on the stack. Unfortunately though, I can't show you any of the work I've done there.
