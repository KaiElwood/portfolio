This was my first forray into the world of socket.io and real-time messaging. I worked with a group of 3 other students to design and put together creative messaging app that allowed each user to draw on a shared canvas and send messages to each other in real-time. The app was built using P5.js for the canvas and socket.io for the real-time messaging. The backend was built using node.js.

Making this project was a lot of fun! The hardest parts about it were figuring out how to take screenshots of the p5 canvas and then send those to the front-end.
{/* how did we do this? I don't remember' */}

The final app can still be accessed here: [Creative Messaging App](https://outgoing-painted-scorpio.glitch.me/)
